# Duffy Changes

## Jun 9th, 2014

### New

- Magnifying glass changes to a spinner to show you when a search is in progress
- We show you an error message when we couldn't perform a search with an option to send us logs.

###Bugs fixed

- Viewing photos in landscape works again

## Jun 6th, 2014

We've been focused on making Duffy a full-fledged gallery replacement with awesome search.  If there's something that's keeping you from using Duffy instead of the default "Photos" app, we want to hear from you!

### New

- Speed speed speed! The new Duffy has been shown to be a bajillion times faster in independent lab evaluations.
- A fresh coat of paint: cleaner look, bigger image previews, better animations
- Recent photos: all your recent photos appear at the bottom of "Everything" even if they haven't been uploaded
- Cleaned up autocomplete results: no more wacky thing suggestions like "nutriment"
- New "No results" page if you search for something with no results
- Fuzzy suggestion counts: we now return 2+, 50+ approximations instead of an exact (but often incorrect) count
- Offline: "Everything" now works offline.  Searches still require a network connection

- Searching for “People” doesn’t work
